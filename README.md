# Holberton School - Cybersecurity Specialization

Welcome to my repository for the **Cybersecurity Specialization** at Holberton School. This collection includes projects and labs completed as part of the program, designed to build expertise in offensive and defensive security, network analysis, cryptography, and more. Each project demonstrates practical applications in real-world scenarios.

## About the Program

The Cybersecurity Specialization at Holberton School provides an intensive, hands-on learning experience. Through various labs and challenges, we gain skills in ethical hacking, threat modeling, and security best practices. 

**Topics Covered:**
- Network security
- Web application security
- System vulnerabilities
- Forensics and incident response
- Offensive security (e.g., penetration testing)
- Defensive security (e.g., firewalls, IDS/IPS)

## Skills Developed

Throughout the program, I have developed strong skills in:
- **Penetration Testing**: Using tools like Metasploit, Burp Suite, and custom scripts for vulnerability discovery.
- **Network Analysis**: Using Wireshark, TCPDump, and analyzing network traffic for unusual patterns.
- **Cryptography**: Understanding encryption, decryption, and key management.
- **Threat Detection & Response**: Identifying, analyzing, and mitigating cyber threats.
- **Scripting & Automation**: Writing scripts in Bash and Python to automate security tasks.
- **Forensics**: Recovering and analyzing digital evidence, memory analysis, and disk imaging.

## Projects

Here are some of the key projects in this repository:

1. **Network Enumeration**  
   - Explored network scanning and information gathering using tools like `nmap`, `netcat`, and custom scripts.
  
2. **Web Application Security**  
   - Analyzed web applications for vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, and used Burp Suite for pentesting.

3. **Password Cracking with John the Ripper and Hydra**  
   - Practiced password security and the effectiveness of password policies by cracking sample hashes.

4. **Packet Analysis with Wireshark**  
   - Captured and analyzed network packets, detecting unusual patterns and security incidents.

5. **Cryptography Implementations**  
   - Implemented basic cryptographic techniques and understood how cryptography protects sensitive data.
