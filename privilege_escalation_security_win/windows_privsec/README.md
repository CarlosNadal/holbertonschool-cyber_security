0. Privilege Escalation in Windows Environments

Objective
Your goal is to extract sensitive data from unattended files

Your target machine is Virtual Machine (VM): LAB01

To locate unattended installation files, extract sensitive administrative credentials, and covertly gain access to retrieve a target flag.
The password for the student account is : Student
The following steps detail the functionality of the Python script and its execution process.
Write a script to resolve this task.
1. Typical File Locations
The script scans the following common locations for unattended installation files:

sysprep.inf
autounattend.xml
Unattend.xml
2. Password Extraction
Utilizes regular expressions to extract the <AdministratorPassword> <Value>(.*?)</Value> from the files.
3. Decoding
Decodes the extracted password.
4. Admin Session
Uses runas to establish an administrative session using the extracted credentials. to get the flag which is in the desktop of the Admin session

1. Privilege Escalation via SAM & SYSTEM Backup Files

Objective
Your objective is to exploit a vulnerability in the system to recover the superAdministrator password and retrieve the flag.
Your target machine is Virtual Machine (VM): LAB02

The password for the Sammy account is :
Sammy
Steps to Complete
Privilege Enumeration

Download and run the PrivCheck PowerShell script on the target system.
Analyze the output to identify the vulnerability .
Research and Exploitation

Research the vulnerability online.
Locate and download a working vulnerability file .exe exploit.
Use the exploit to extract critical files from the target system.
Hash Extraction

Switch to Kali Linux and ensure the Impacket toolkit is installed.
Use the secretdump.py tool to extract hashed password from the files.
Administrator Session Access

Use the recovered hashes to open an Administrator session.
Obtain the flag from the session and save it.

2. Hijack the Service - Exploit Weak Permissions

Your target machine is Virtual Machine (VM): LAB03
The password for the student account is : Student
A service running with elevated privileges has weak file permissions. Youâ€™ve identified that it loads a DLL from a writable directory, giving you an opportunity to hijack it and escalate your privileges.

Can you hijack the service by exploiting the weak permissions and loading a malicious DLL to gain SYSTEM access?

Try to use this to get the flag from the superAdministrator:

Example of DLL code :

SprintCSPDLL.
use win 10 RpcClient to execute the dll :

WIN10RpcClient.exe.
1. Run privcheck
Execute privcheck in the terminal to check for services with weak permission .
2. Check for writable path
Review privcheck check the output for any writable paths.
3. Generate a DLL
Create a DLL file.
Write code to add user with admin prev privilege .
Compile the DLL.
4. Copy DLL to Confluence bin
Copy the DLL to the writable paths.
5. Trigger DLL with RPCClient
Use RPCClient to load and execute the DLL.
6. Retrieve flag
Flag Location: C:\User\superAdministrator\Desktop

3. PowerShell Transcript Files Lab

Your target machine is Virtual Machine (VM): LAB04
The password for the student account is : Student
From the powershell
1. Understand the PowerShell Transcription Environment
Ensure transcription is configured and active on your system.
2. Locate PowerShell Transcript Files
Search for PowerShell transcript files on the system to identify their location.
4. Analyze Privilege Escalation Opportunities
Analyze the transcript files for any evidence of privilege escalation or unauthorized actions that might have been executed through the exploitation of the transcript logs.
5. Locate the Hidden Flag
Search the transcript files for any concealed flags, potentially hidden within command outputs or injected data.
